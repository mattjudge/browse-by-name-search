# browse-by-name-search

## Summary

This add-on adds a search engine to the browser, that sends the search term to Google, making use of its Browse by Name feature. This is a cross between "I'm feeling lucky", and a normal search. Using Browse by Name, the searcher is only redirected to the first result if there is a very high probability of it being the "correct" result.

The url loaded is of the form `https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q={searchTerms}`.

It also adds a keyword "bbn", so you can type "bbn wikipedia" and get sent to wikipedia immediately.
